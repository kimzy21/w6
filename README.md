# Download cors if you haven't already - npm install cors
# create package.json file - npm init
# edit index.html, products.js and index.js accordingly for the product images to appear
# to check if backend is working properly after updating everything, type http://localhost:3000/collections/products in your browser. It should return a JSON page with contents of products.js
# check if all dependencies have been added to the package.json file
# DO NOT DELETE package-lock.json - nevermind I deleted it so... Nothing changed - you can discard it
# I would advise you to create a .gitignore folder and  paste node_modules/ in it so you don't commit the node modules file on github (644 commits otherwise)
# if you have any questions, feel free to contact me
